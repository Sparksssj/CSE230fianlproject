There are treasures and traps in it, and the diggers decided to make a race to test who can get more golds in the pyramid. However, golds often comes with danger. This secret pyramid received a curse. There are some traps and mummies here which may lead the prospectors to death. I know you are the one of the greatest warriors in the world, so I invite you to come here. Good luck.
